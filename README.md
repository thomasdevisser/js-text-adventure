# js-text-adventure

A JavaScript text adventure, built to train my testing skills and learn Git Actions.

## Introduction

The game will be about you, a wizard, walking through Hogwarts looking for a hidden house that has been the home of all the house elves between shifts in the kitchen.

## Mechanics

The way the game works is you can move between different locations. Not every location is accessible right away. In every location there's a few things you can do.

- Talk to the person there, if there is anyone
- Look what/who is in that location
- Find items
- Use items
- Go to another location
