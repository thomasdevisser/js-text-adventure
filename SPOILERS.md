## Items

- Ron's sock
  To give to one of the house elves, they'll thank you and let you know where the entrance is
- Fred & George's map
  Shows you can get to the kitchen by passing the teacher's room
- Dumbledore's Cloak
  To sneak past the teachers to the kitchen
- Hagrid's kitchen key
  Gives access to the kitchen where you can get info where the entrance is
- Vilder's password note
  Contains the password to enter the house
- Luna's weird glasses
  With these you can see the entrance to the house, where you'll need a password

## Walkthrough

- You start in the Entrance Hall
- You can already obtain the sock, the map, the cloak and the weird glasses
- Once you have the cloak, you can also obtain the kitchen key and the password note
- With all items collected, you can trade the sock for information from the goblins
- If you don't have the key, you can also type alohomora to open the kitchen door (game secret)
- Once you have the password, the glasses and the location, you can enter the hidden house!
